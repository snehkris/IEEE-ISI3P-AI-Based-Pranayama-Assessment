# IEEE-ISI3P-AI-Based-Pranayama-Assessment
A research project for real-time Pranayama assessment using breathing audio analysis, pose estimation, and machine learning.


> AI-powered assessment of Anulom Vilom and Kapalbhati using audio signal processing and computer vision.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on the automated assessment of Pranayama techniques by combining:

- 🎧 Quantitative analysis from breathing audio
- 📷 Qualitative analysis from body posture
- 🤖 AI and Computer Vision for real-time feedback

The goal is to develop an intelligent system capable of evaluating breathing quality and posture during Pranayama practice.
